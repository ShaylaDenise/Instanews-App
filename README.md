# Instanews-App

### Project Summary
My INSTANEWS project is an app for The New York Times official website. It is a responsive web application that fetches up-to-date news articles, their respective URL's and images from the New York Times API. It is user friendly for mobile, tablet and desktop and delivers a loading gif upon image load to give users a loading visual to clarify its loading appropriately.

### Personal Learnings

* Using ESlint for the first time. 
* Using the AJAX method 'GET' I was able to take formatted JSON data from the web and implement it on my page. 
* Implementing the on Change function to allow for adjustments when a page was selected from the drop down menu.
